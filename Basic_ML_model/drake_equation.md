N = R* × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

Where:\
N = The number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we could potentially communicate.\
R* = The average rate of star formation in our galaxy.\
fp = The fraction of those stars that have planets.\
ne = The average number of planets that could support life per star with planets.\
fl = The fraction of those planets that develop life.\
fi = The fraction of those planets with life that develop intelligent life.\
fc = The fraction of those intelligent civilizations that develop the ability to communicate across interstellar distances.\
L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.
